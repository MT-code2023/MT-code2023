### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently learning Python with HyperionDev.
- I'm working on two programs. Please find a little infomation below about the projects.
- I'm happy to colaborate and to get more involved within the Github community.

###### Mental Capacity Act

The objective of this program is to enable carers or employees working with people with cognitive difficulties to know when a Mental Capacity Assessment is necessary. It will also provide signposting information and links to assist them, following the apps use.

###### Football Match Predictor

Now this one is just a bit of fun! The objective is to try to predict the outcome of a football match. The idea is to focus on the various factors that influence any potential outcome and then to build them into an algorithm.
